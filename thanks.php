            successful of a team as we are.</p>
        <h2>Alex - Android File Host</h2>
        <p>Alex and <a href="https://www.androidfilehost.com">Android File Host</a> provide the web server that
            Team BlueRidge uses for all our web-based services. Without Alex, none of our current projects would be able
            to exist.<br />If you are an Android developer, consider hosting your files at Android File host,
            which provides free hosting for all your ROMs, apps, and tools. Additionally, there are
            <a href="https://androidfilehost.com/user/?w=select-membership-plans">paid plans</a> available which allow
            you to have faster upload times, Twitter integration, and more.<br />If you are an Android user, consider
            asking your favorite developer to host on Android File Host if they don&apos;t already.</p>
