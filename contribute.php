    <h1>Contribute</h1>
    <p class="lead">Team BlueRidge appreciates contributions and support of any form; whether it is a contribution of code, a monetary contribution, or a note telling us you appreciate one of our projects.</p>
    <div class="subsections">
      <h2>Code Contribution</h2>
      <p class="lead">If you wish to contribute directly to one of our projects, the preferred method of doing so is by using our <a href="https://review.teamblueridge.org">Gerrit</a>. This allows us to have continual conversation about the code being contributed and makes submitting multiple patches for the same change easier to track. In situations where Gerrit is not a feasible option, we will also accept pull requests directly to our <a href="https://github.com/teamblueridge">GitHub</a> repositories; however these contributions will take longer to process.<br />
        If you would like to see a list of the current issues that we are trying to solve across our projects, please check out our <a href="https://issues.teamblueridge.org">issue tracker</a>.</p>
      <h2>Donations</h2>
      <p class="lead">Team BlueRidge gratefully accepts any financial contributions to our PayPal account. You may send money to <code>webmaster@teamblueridge.com</code>. Any financial contributions will be used for maintaining servers or for other discretionary purposes as the team sees necessary.</p>
      <h2>Support</h2>
      <p class="lead">We love to hear about the ways that users have benefited from our services and projects. If you would like to share your story with us, please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
